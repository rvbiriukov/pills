# 💊 Digital Pillbox

Just a simple, vibe-coded app to help track daily medications. Built because I needed a better way to remember my vitamins without the clinical feel of standard medical apps.

## ✨ Features

- **Vibe-Coded UI**: Clean, glassmorphism design that feels premium and calm.
- **Smart Scheduling**: Presets for Morning (Sunrise), Afternoon (Sun), and Evening (Moon) with beautiful dynamic gradients.
- **Flexible Frequencies**: Track daily meds or specific days of the week.
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported, deep blue/slate theme for late-night check-ins.
- **Privacy First**: All data stays in your browser's local storage. No accounts, no tracking.

- **Multilingual**: Speaks English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
